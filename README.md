## Project Description (Subject to change - I will keep adding and editing ideas/plans.)
<br />
The goal of this project is to create a fitness tracker app. This app will manage a user's profile, keep tracking of exercise log (e.g. exercise time, what kind of exercise, etc.), and share the progress with friends who are using the same app. A user will be able to set the goal for his or her fitness for a certain amount of time in the profile. The design concept for this app is simple and minimalistic.
